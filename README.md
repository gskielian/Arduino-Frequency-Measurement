Arduino-Frequency-Measurement
=============================

A collection &amp;&amp; comparison of methods for measuring frequency on the Arduino with credits


### FreqCount Library



### pulseIn()

The `pulseIn()` function can be used to detect the length of a pulse (it waits for the pulse to begin, and then returns the microsecond-width of said pulse).

example:

```ino
pulseIn(3, HIGH); // waits for 3 to turn HIGH, then returns the amount of us until it turns LOW again
```

An example how how to utilze this for frequency detection is provided.

**Specs:**

- can be used on _any_ pin
- 10us < pulse width < 3min
- due to the `10us` lower limit, 100kHz is the upper limit for pulseIn's frequency detection
